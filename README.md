# Statistical Learning — Assignment 3

This repository contains ISLR-style exercises implemented in Python. Each question includes code, plots, and a markdown report summarizing analysis, methods, and results.

Each question directory includes a detailed markdown report (`question1_report.md`, `question2_report.md`, `question3_report.md`) describing objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- Required packages:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## Running the Scripts

Execute each question directly from the project root:

```
# Question 1
python Assignment3/Q1/question1_analysis.py

# Question 2
python Assignment3/Q2/question2_analysis.py

# Question 3
python Assignment3/Q3/question3_analysis.py
```

All generated plots are saved in the corresponding `plots/` directory, and analysis summaries are documented in each question’s markdown report.

---

## Notes

- Each `Q1`, `Q2`, and `Q3` folder includes a detailed markdown report (`question1_report.md`, `question2_report.md`, `question3_report.md`) describing methods used and interpretations of results.
- Ensure datasets (`Auto.csv`, `Default.csv`, `College.csv`) are present in the respective `data/` folders before running the scripts.
